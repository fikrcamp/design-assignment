  <img class="images"  src="./Laas Geel.jpeg"/>
  <p>At Laas Geel are to be found some of the Africa's oldest and most beautiful prehistoric cave paintings.
    daubed on the golden, umber rocks of an outcrop in the arid desert landscape 50km or so outside the Somaliland capital of Hargeisa.
    their relative obscurity is partly due to the fact that they were only recently discovered, in 2002, by a French group of archaeologists.
    the paintings importance was recognized immediately, and estimates of their age range from 5,000 years to more than 10,000,
    putting them in the neolithic age, and thus more recent than Europe's famous Paleolithic examples, giving the visitorsa glimpse into a very different world.
    Laas Geel translates as where the giraffes once watered. As well as giraffe, the paintings depict antelope, possibly domesticated dogs, and certainly cows,
    the last of these lacking the hump that has been bred-in over the intervening millennia.
