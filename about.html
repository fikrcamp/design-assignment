      Tech has a massive skills shortage, and web developers are finding that
      the classic job descriptors no longer match. More and more companies favor
      results over time-based experience. A good boot camp for web development
      and a few high-level projects on Github are potentially all you need to
      land a lucrative full-time job as a software engineer.
